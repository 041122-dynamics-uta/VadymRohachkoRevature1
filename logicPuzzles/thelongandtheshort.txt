Puzzle #4

The Long and the Short of It:
Hereâ€™s a great logic puzzle for kids: Six neighborhood children (Leisha, Benito, Delia, Charlotte, Weldon, and Zina) were measured yesterday.
Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina.
Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon.
Benito is not the shortest.
Can you put them in order of height from tallest to shortest?

Benito -> Leisha -> (Delia or Weldon)
Delia -> Weldon
Weldon -> Zina
Benito is not #1

so:

Benito -> Leisha -> Delia -> Weldon -> Zina

as soon as Benito is the shortest among 5 kids and is not the shortest, then Charlotte is the shortest.

Charlot -> Benito -> Leisha -> Delia -> Weldon -> Zina
