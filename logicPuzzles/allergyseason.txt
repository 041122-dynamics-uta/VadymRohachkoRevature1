Allergy Season

Task:
Five friends (Allegra, Ben, Clara, Flora, and Zach) are each allergic to something different: pollen, shellfish, bee stings, cats, or nuts.
Allegra has a food allergy
Ben can play with his kitten for hours without issue (or medicine).
Clara’s allergy is not related to animals.
Flora has seasonal allergies.

Question:
Can you figure out who is allergic to what?

Solution:
Flora has seasonal allergies.
So, it is Pollen.

Clara’s allergy is not related to animals.
So, they are either pollen or nuts. Pollen is for Flora.
Clara/nuts

Allegra has a food allergy
We have shellfis or nuts, nuts are for Clara
so, Allegra/shellfish

Ben can play with his kitten for hours without issue (or medicine).
Only cats and bee stings are left
so, Ben bee stings

so, for Zach only cats are left.

Flora   - pollen
Clara   - nuts
Allegra - shellfish
Ben     - bee stings
Zach    - cats
