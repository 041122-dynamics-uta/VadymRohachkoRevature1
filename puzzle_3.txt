Presidents Day:
George, William, John, Abe, and Millard have their birthdays on consecutive days, all between Monday and Friday.
George’s birthday is as many days before Millard’s and William’s is after Abe’s.
John is two days older than Abe.
Millard’s birthday is on Thursday.
Can you figure out whose birthday is on each day?

Miilard - Thursday

George is older than Millard
William is younger than Abe
John is older than Abe

Two groups on the time line:
1. George before Millard
2. John before Abe before William

As soon as John is two days older than Abe and Thursday is occupied, then Abe can occupy either Wendsday or Friday.
But William is younger than Abe, so the only day for Abe is Wendsday.

Abe - Wendsday
John - Monday
Millard - Thursday

If William's day (Friday) is on the second day after Abe, then George's day is on the second day (Tuesday) before Millard's.
William - Friday
George - Tuesday

Final result:

John    - Monday
George  - Tuesday
Abe     - Wendsday
Millard - Thursday
William - Friday
